Hello! Thank you for opening up the project!

This is currently an ongoing research project that will be published later with the help of the head of the FAU cyber security department. Written in Python, the project is an experiment to use Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning to fight road sign image attacks in the cybersecurity field. When an image is altered many neural networks fail to recognize the road sign which can lead to dangerous outcomes. Using different deep learning python libraries, I have overcome certain obstacles to help further the cybersecurity fight against road sign manipulation such as pixel enhancements and training alterations. Please enjoy the first draft paper along with the pdf version that shows the code being run in Google colab.


Thanks! Hope you enjoy this project!
