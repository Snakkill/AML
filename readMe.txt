Hello! Thank you for opening up the project!

I have included 3 pdfs for your viewing pleasure, to better understand the stages of the projects development.

1.)75%.pdf is a pdf of the notebook that was ran with the baseline CNN. It was the first model attempt with a  75% accuracy along with its fooling results.

2.)92%.pdf is a pdf of the notebook that was ran with the improved CNN. It was the second model attempt with a  92% accuracy along with its fooling results. It builds on after the first notebook and therefore is a continuation of the 75%.pdf so you must scroll past the first fooling to observer its true contents.

3.)92%_in_color.pdf (recommend) is the final pdf notebook. It is the same as 92%.pdf but is saved in order to show the coding and results in diffrent colors. A more polished version. 





If you would like to run the experiment yourself you must do the following:

1.) Download the image dataset "AdverTrafficIMages" provided and the "fooling" image dataset.

Fooling images Link

2.)Upload them to the same google drive account you plan to open the google collaboration on.

3.) Make file path changes if necessary and run the notebook with the collaboration link here:

4.)(optional) TrafficSign.ipynb is the notebook file which can be ran in applications such as Jupiter notebooks or upload and opened in a personal google collaboration if you would prefer. Just make sure to adjust the file paths to access your image dataset.



*If you run into any issues along the way or have issues with the collaboration link please do not hesitate to contact me at amoubayed2017@fau.edu*


Thanks! Hope you enjoy this project!
